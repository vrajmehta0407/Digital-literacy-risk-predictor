# Permissions Explained

To protect you, the Digital Literacy Risk Predictor requires several permissions. Here is why:

## SMS Permissions
*   **RECEIVE_SMS**: To automatically check incoming messages for scams as soon as they arrive.
*   **READ_SMS**: To analyze past messages if you ask the app to scan your inbox.
*   **SEND_SMS**: Strictly used to send an alert to your chosen family Guardian in an emergency.

## Phone Permissions
*   **READ_PHONE_STATE**: To detect when you are receiving a call.
*   **READ_CALL_LOG**: To check if a caller is in your contact list or is unknown/suspicious.

## Contacts Permission
*   **READ_CONTACTS**: To verify if a caller or message sender is someone you know (Safe) or a stranger (Potential Risk).

## Privacy Promise
We **never** send your messages, contacts, or call logs to any cloud server. All analysis happens right here on your phone.
